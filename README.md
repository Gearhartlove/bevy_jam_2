Cook fantastical foods for friends in a wholesome point and click adventure. Combine 
magical  but familiar ingredients too add new recipes to your cook book.

This is [Fuzzy Camel Studios](https://www.fuzzycamel.com/) submission for the 
[Bevy Jam #2](https://itch.io/jam/bevy-jam-2). The theme was *Combine*. 

This jam was different in a number of ways. Firsty, the game is programmed using Rust in 
conjunction with the [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) engine! As a team, we approached the 
game from a *data-driven* perspective, as opposed to the more conventional object models. 
And secondly, [@MrVintage710](https://github.com/MrVintage710) joined our team to help with the 
design and programming!

Check back in a week or so for an official Fuzzy Camel Chews on Game Design talk about everything
*The Fantastical Cookbook*.
